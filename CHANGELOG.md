> In general you should only be using the containerized database installs
> for testing and development and should be using a managed db solution.
>
> However if you were using a containerized installation this is a
> breaking change and you will need to backup your database and then
> restore it into the newly created database.
>
> As a result of this change the MySQL chart is now a statefulset and as
> such the PVCs are not cleaned up automatically for you and will need to
> be deleted prior.

> from `slave` to `replicas`, and therefore
