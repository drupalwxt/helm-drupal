Helm Chart: Solr
================

A Helm chart to easily create solr instances for use with the official Apache Solr Operator.

> Note: You will need to deploy the solr operator using the latest helm chart in github as there is no published release yet.

* https://github.com/StatCan/charts/tree/master/stable/solr-operator (temporary fork until there is a official published helm release)

The Operator can be deploy if you are already using Terraform with:
